### Versions
* **Version 1.1**:
  <br>1. Fixed a feature where when you choose to pick days to repeat the study session, it shows a disruptive alert, replaced it with a non-disruptive pop-up message.
  <br>2. Fixed a bug where if you choose a day to repeat the study session wherein it doesn't contain the current day and the time chosen has passed, the pop-up doesn't display proper texts.
* **Version 1.2**:
  <br>1. The application is now more optimized.
  <br>2. Added action button where you can delete the session from the notification.
  <br>3. Added an info button when adding/editing a task.
  <br>4. Fixed a bug where if you start with a decimal and if it starts with 0 in read time, the program crashes.
  <br>5. Label can accomodate until 20 characters, and read time will only accept 3 digits, because realistically, it is not recommended to study for more than 1 day straight.
